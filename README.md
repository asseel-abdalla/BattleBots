# BattleBots

File AsseelBot is the robot created by me. Other files were provided to run the arena. In this repository, sample bots can be used to test my robot. However, during the real competition, other people's robots that they also coded were used to compete against mine.

HumanBot can be controlled by you! Use the arrow keys to try to kill my robot!
